# Selection Sort

Selection sort is simple in-place sorting algorithm. Take a list of numbers as input and sort them.

# Working

Maintain two subarrays in given array: 
    <ol><li>Subarray which is already sorted</li>
    <li>Remaining subarray which is unsorted</li></ol>
Find the maximum number from the unsorted subarray and put it at the end of unsorted subarray.
   
# Complexcity

Complexcity of Selection sort algorithm is O(n^2) but the data movement is minimal because only linear number of swaps are required.
